# Overview of the analysis:

The purpose of this analysis is to help Beks be able to predict whether a particular investment would bring back a return or not. This way they can reduce their risk and make a more informed decision where to invest based on data.

# Results:

## Data Preprocessing

### - What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model? 

The Success Rate.

### - What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model? 

EIN, Name, Application Type, Classification, Organization, Income Amount, and Ask Amount 

### - What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data? 

Anything less than 500 should be removed

## Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

### - How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?

### - What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?

Trained the model, ran random forecast, fitting the model and evaluateing the model

# Summary: Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and explain your recommendation.

Overall it seemed to have a high success rate and works as intended. It will be a good tool to help Beks make investing decisions.
